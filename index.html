        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Sanika Pradhan, a scientist by training 
            and an artist by heart—two worlds that collide beautifully here. 
            My journey weaves through microscopes and canvas, where science reveals the mechanisms of the universe, and art reimagines them with color, emotion, and wonder. 
            At The SciArt Studio, I illustrate the elegance of scientific disciplines, 
            from cells to galaxies—with a splash of creative energy. 
            This space is where formulas find rhythm, molecules find movement, 
            and complexity finds beauty. Science fuels the logic. 
            Art sparks the magic. And together, they energize everything I create. 
        </p>
